# Build spict stock

# Let's work with a good time series for hovy in GSA Anc6.
# What is available: 
  # catch since 1945
  # biomass index since 2002
  # effort index for Purse seine in kw*Days and fishing days


# Load the .csv file

ane <- read.csv("ANE_06_nonAge.csv")

# look at the file, what do we have there?
View(ane)

# Assemble stock

ane6 <- vector("list")

# Import Catch data (Landings plus Discards)

ane6$obsC  <- ane$catch  #catch observations
ane6$timeC <- ane$year   # time of catch observations

ane6$obsC <- c(ane6$obsC, 17830.4) # adding an extra value to update the stock
ane6$timeC <- c(ane6$timeC, 2016)  # adding an extra value to update the year

#Plot inital guesses on the model initial values

#The two top plots come from plotspict.data, with the dashed horizontal line representing a guess of MSY.
#This guess comes from a linear regression between the index and the catch divided by the index (middle row,left). This regression is expected to have a negative slope. A similar plot can be made showing catch versus catch/index (middle row, right) to approximately find the optimal effort (or effort proxy). The proportional increase in the index as a function of catch (bottom row, right) should show primarily positive increasesin index at low catches and vice versa. Positive increases in index at large catches could indicate model violations (Source SPICT Vignette)

#The FLStock of plaice and the FLIndex, are both at age, and the index has only the abundance (Catch.n)

# First step is to take what is needed from the FLStock and collapse along the age dimensions.
