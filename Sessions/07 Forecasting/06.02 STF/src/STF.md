# Performing projections

Why?

* Requirement of the stock assessment process
* Predict the future
* Understand potential consequences of management actions

Short and Medium term

Results depend on many assumptions

# Projections in FLR

Use the *FLash* package

* Set up the future stock object
* Make assumptions about the future
    * weights at age
    * selectivity pattern
    * etc
* Set up the projection 'control'
* Run and explore the results

# Short Term Forecast (STF)

3 year projection

*What is going to happen in the next few years is probably similar to what happened in the last few years* 

* 'Standard' assumptions based on average of last few years
* Limited modelling of biology (no SRR)
* Set up lots of F scenarios
* Exploratory
* No uncertainty

# Medium Term Forecast

5 - 10 year projection

* Model specific management and biological scenarios
* Includes more biology (SRR)
* Uncertainty
