# Biological Reference Points

Management requires targets and limits:

* Where to go
* When to stop

#YPR and SPR
 In general, reference points from yield-per-recruit (YPR)  and spawning-stock-biomass-per-recruit (SPR) analyses are easy to calculate because relatively few data are required; in particular, it is not necessary to obtain stock-recruitment data.  
For this reason, YPR and SPR reference points are often used as proxies for other ref-
erence points that do require stock and recruitment data


# Common Target Reference Points
## Fmax
- Consider the long-term yield per recruit, Y/R, as a function of F, for a certain exploitation pattern.
- Fmax is the point of the curve, Y/R against F, where Y/R is maximum. If Y/R is flat topped Fmax can't be estimated. Fmax  only indicates the value of F which gives the maximum possible yield per recruit from a cohort during its life, for a given exploitation pattern

# F0.1
- F0.1 is the fishing mortality rate at which the slope of the yield per recruit curve as a function of fishing mortality is 10% of its value at the origin  
- F0.1  can be calculated  even when the curve is asymptotical or flat-top.

# Fmsy
- Fmsy is defined as being the value of F which produces the maximum yield in the long-term. It is necessary to select an S-R relat.ion to estimate FMSY. This point is different from Fmax, if no S-R will be equal to Fmax. The EU CFP mandates stocks to be at the level of Fmsy

# YPR sensitivity to change in M
Levels of M in the stock change significantly the YPR curve.

# YPR sensitivity to change in max age
Maximum age of fish in the stock affects YPR curve in the peak.

# FLBRP

* From stock assessment results and SR model fit
* let's see how it works in FLR => FLBRP
