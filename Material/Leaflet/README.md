% Training Course on **Quantitative Fisheries Science using FLR and a4a**
% European Commission Joint Research Centre
% 24-28 August 2015. Ispra, Italy

The Maritime Affairs Unit of the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC Ispra), Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen (IPSC) is pleased to announce a the third edition of the training course **Quantitative Fisheries Science using FLR and a4a** which will introduce fisheries scientists to the use and application of the tools developed by the FLR project (<http://flr-project.org>) and the a4a Initiative (<https://fishreg.jrc.ec.europa.eu/web/a4a>) for the quantitative analysis of fisheries data and the provision of advice on stock status and management.

The FLR library is a collection of tools in the R statistical language that facilitates the construction of bio-economic simulation models of fisheries and ecological sytems. It is a generic toolbox, but is specifically suited for the construction of simulation models for evaluations of fisheries management strategies. The FLR library is under development by researchers across a number of laboratories and universities.

The a4a Initiative has develoiped a series of models and computational tools that can 
be applied rapidly to a large number of stocks, without requiring a strong statistical technical background, but making use of the technical knowledge on the fisheries, stocks and ecosystem characteristics

The course will introduce the basic structure of FLR, familiarize users with the available procedures and methods, cover the most important steps of interest to participants in stock assessment working groups, and present the ways in which FLR code can be adapted and extended to your needs. This will include the use of FLa4a package, which implements the a4a model as part of FLR.

# DATES & VENUE

This course will take place over 8 half-day sessions, on 24-28 August 2015 at the Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy. The course will start at 13.00 on Monday, 24 August, and end at 12.00 on Friday 28 August 2015.

Shuttle transport will be organized from Milano airports (MXP, LIN) or train stations to Ispra.

A block booking will be available at Hotel Europa, Ispra (<www.isprahoteleuropa.it/>), but participoants are free to make their own arrangements.
